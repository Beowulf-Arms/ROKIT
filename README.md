# ROKIT
The Beowulf ROKIT System is a project to provide mission makers with an option for a OpFor AI artillery system that doesn't wreak havoc on players, but still provides a challenge.

-	Dramatic, scary, and dangerous AI artillery support option designed to enhance mission experience
-	No additional mods required
-	Just place the ROKIT launcher (currently just a Mk6 Mortar model), and register the artillery in LAMBS DANGER
-	Now available with HE or Cluster munitions!
- ROKIT's have a chance of detonating early before reaching their target mid-air, or fail to detonate on impact creating UXO!
-	Optional config for 3CB MLRS technical (ten tubes are better then one!)

# What is ROKIT?
Built from the ground up to be used with AI mods such as LAMBs DANGER. The ROKIT system fires custom rockets with a deadly but not devastating payload. With a dramatic smoke trail, a chance for early detonations and scatterings of unexploded ordinance. You’ll find this provides an interesting challenge for the players without risking the entire mission to a well-placed mortar bomb and lack of spacing!

# What does this mod add?
 The Beowulf ROKIT mod adds the Beowulf ROKIT artillery system (currently an alternate version of the Mk6 mortar). You can find the launcher in the "Turrets" catagory of NATO, CSAT, and AAF
 The included optional addon included in the Optional folder of this mod, provides an MLRS version of the ROKIT artillery on the back of a Hilux using the 3CB Hilux.


# How to ROKIT?
 We’d recommend using ROKIT with LAMBs DANGER, or another AI mod that introduces an automatic artillery call function with adjustments. This way the ROKIT’s will get called by the AI automatically, and won’t be perfectly ranged in on the first attempt!
 Simply place the ROKIT with your chosen AI crewmember (You can always replace the crewman with your favourite faction!) and enable your chosen artillery/AI system. Then watch the ROKIT’s fly!

# Why ROKIT?
 As mission makers in our community, we didn’t like to use artillery. We found it could be quite overwhelming (maybe just an us problem?). So we wanted to tone down artillery damage so its playable, and doesn’t completely ruin a session when a well placed shell/bomb/rocket smashes half the platoon. This did the trick! But we wanted to take it a stage further, and so came up with an artillery system that allowed for counter-battery in our sized missions. 
 By having the huge plumes of smoke billowing out the back of the rockets as they launch into the air, and scream back down to earth above the players heads. It allowed the players to react to the threat and not be so disappointing when your session was cut short because that first shot of incoming landed perfectly.

# THIS ISN’T REALISTIC, MY IMMERSION REEEEE
 Cool story bro… you do you. We’re not here to show you THE BEST WAY. We’re offering the wider community a different way to enjoy the tactical realism space, with a possible solution that still provides a challenge and level of difficulty. But doesn’t overwhelm… and hey it looks cool!
